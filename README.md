# Arcade Classics

Here is a collection of classic arcade games!

I've written this in Godot 4 to practice making something work looking at. It's in a very rough state, but please enjoy!

Everything in here is free to use for personal use, though not permitted to modify, distribute, or sell.

Take a look at the current state of the project:

<!--
regenerate the thumbnail with this command:
ffmpeg -i ./thumbnail.avi -vf "fps=10,scale=640:-1:flags=lanczos,split[s0][s1];[s0]palettegen[p];[s1][p]paletteuse" -loop -1 thumbnail.gif
